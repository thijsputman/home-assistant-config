# Some windows are often ajar/open for ventilation purposes. Relying solely on
# contact sensors doesn't accurately represent their state. For these windows
# an (additional) vibration sensor (which also reports orientation) is used.
# This only works well for windows that tilt on the horizontal plane, so not all
# windows for which this approach would be applicable can actually use it...
