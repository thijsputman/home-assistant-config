# Estimate power consumption of all lights
#
# Made possible by the fact that all lights in the house are Hue-/Zigbee-based.
# Enumerates all lights (that are not a Hue-group nor a Home Assistant light
# group). Provides a rough estimate – to keep things simple, light intensity is
# not factored in and lights are only roughly grouped...
#
# Lights are grouped as follows:
#   1.  Lights that are switched off are assumed to consume 0.4 Watt – based on
#       <https://www.anandtech.com/show/6805/philips-hue-automated-home-lighting-gets-colorful/6>
#   2.  All 2-meter light-strips, assumed to be using 50% of their 24 Watt
#       rating
#   3.  The Ensuite ceiling light (which contains 6 individual bulbs), assumed
#       to be using 33% of its 36 Watt rating
#   4.  The Aqara smart-relay gang in the Attic hallway connected to two 3.5
#       Watt LED spots and one 18 Watt LEDtube, roughly 25 Watt (the other gang,
#       with just two LED spots, is – conveniently – assumed to be part of the
#       next grouping)
#   5.  All other lights (ranging from 6 to 9 Watt), assumed to be using 4 Watt
#       each

- trigger:
    # Sample data once-per-minute – 10 seconds after the whole minute to prevent
    # overlapping with all other sampling/time-based template triggers...
