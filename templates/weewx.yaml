- sensor:
    # "Net" evapotranspiration â€“ no idea whether this truly makes sense, but it
    # sort of looks like it does: Both values are integrated to mm/day (from
    # mm/min and mm/hour respectively) and seem to track each other reasonably
    # well over time.
    # The idea here is to provide an indication of how much water the garden
    # needs. For now this is graphed (as daily deltas) alongside the amount of
    # water provided to the garden. Both daily "bars" should be roughly at the
    # same level for the garden to get a (net) stable amount of water. The
    # actual amount of watering required is (for now) empirically determined...
