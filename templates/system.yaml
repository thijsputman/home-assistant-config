# If the Home Alarm is in "Armed away"-mode for more than 16 hours, enable
# Vacation-mode â€“ indicating we are away from home longer than on a regular
# working day.
# This mainly serves to make some of the alarm triggers stricter (a false alarm
# when coming home from a trip is less of an issue than one that can occur daily
# coming home from the office), but it has other potential uses too.
# Triggers at the top of every hour (and on Home Alarm disarm) to prevent
# unnecessarily rendering a not highly time-sensitive template.
