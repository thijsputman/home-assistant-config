# Heuristically track the Hue scene name based on the group's (i.e. Hue
# room/zone) brightness, color_temp and/or xy_color and the number of lights
# switched on.
#
# Uses the groups of lights defined in "ðŸ“„ groups/hue.yaml" to enumerate the
# number of lights switched on. This greatly increases the accuracy of the
# heuristic (as otherwise switching on a single light in a room would often
# detect the previous scene for that room as the active scene).
# When a room is switched on, changing individual lights (or vice versa,
# switching on the entire room when individual lights are on) might â€“ or might
# not â€“ lead to an update in the detected scene. This greatly depends on whether
# the Hui API actually reports it as a state change... Coping with this caveat
# is currently beyond the scope of the heuristic.
#
# Note that when a Hue *zone* changes, the Hue *room(s)* it belongs to keep
# reporting their previous state (i.e. some of their lights  changed, but the
# Hue API doesn't report on these changes).
# The inverse behaviour does _not_ apply to zones: Changing their containing
# room(s) _does_ change the state of the zone.
# This behaviour is utilised by the Kitchen-room, which is set up to track the
# state of the Kitchen counter & cupboards-zone.
#
# Furthermore, if a zone change causes a room to transition from off to on, the
# room *does* report a state change (namely, it will start reporting its last
# active/on state). This causes the below heuristic to fail, as such exceptions
# have to be put in place to handle this "off-on" scenario...
