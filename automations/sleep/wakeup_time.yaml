    # defined below). If the alarm is to sound a second time during the same
    # day, simple cancel the timer...

    # create race-conditions with the other automations running at Â«wakeupÂ»
    # time (and thus unintentionally prevents them from running).
    # Interestingly, this only recently (as of HA 2022.2) became an issue, prior
    # to that it has worked fine without the delay for a long time... ğŸ¤¨
