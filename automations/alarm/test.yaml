            To test the sirens, they will sound for 1 second followed by a 10
            second delay and then sound for 2 seconds. After this, all alarm
            devices' lights will blink for 3 minutes to allow for a visual
            inspection...<br><br>
            Additionally, directly after the sirens stop sounding you should
            receive an SMS message from Home Assistant allowing you to validate
            the SMS notification service is working as intended...
    # Wait for 10 minutes and 30 seconds ‚Äì this ensures our test coincides with
    # the monthly test of the public alarm sirens in The Netherlands. These
    # sirens are tested every first Monday of the month at 12:00 for 1 minute
    # and 26 seconds.
    - delay: "00:10:30"
    # First set mode "select" (which sounds and blinks for 1 second); wait 10
    # seconds; set mode "lselect" with "ontime" 10 (sound and blink for 10
    # seconds) and after 2 seconds set mode "none" (which should stop the sound
    # and blink ‚Äì testing that silencing the alarm also works). Finally, set
    # mode "blink" for 3 minutes to allow for a visual inspection of the alarm
    # alarm devices.
