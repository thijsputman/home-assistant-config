# The Recorder's SQLite-database is on a separate NVMe USB-drive that – although
# generally stable – occasionally disconnects. It reconnects right away and the
# filesystem is automatically remounted, but Docker doesn't take very kindly to
# this: All containers using the volume need to be stopped and only then (once
# they're all down) restarted for the volume to become accessible again...
# The Raspberry Pi 4 is quite picky where it comes to its USB-drives: The one
# I'm currently using has historically been stable (not 100% though, which is
# why it's not the boot-volume). Recently I've discovered that – given the right
# atmospheric conditions – touching it causes a static shock which reconnects
# the drive... ⚡
