# The Gledopto controllers in the Kitchen are a bit stubborn; they don't always
# respond to the first scene change request nor do they always properly switch
# off when asked to do so... See "ðŸ“„ docs/HUE.md" for more details.
# The below aims to keep the "off" state of the Gledopto controllers in line
# with the other lights in the Kitchen (which don't exhibit this aberrant
# behaviour).
