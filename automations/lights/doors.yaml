# Front and Kitchen door have almost identical automations. They are not folded
# into a single automation as that would cause problems when both doors are
# opened at the same time. Parrallelising the automation (to cope with both
# doors opening at the same time) in turn causes problems with reverting the
# light back to its original state (as restarting the automation for the same
# door midway through causes it to always the detect the original state as
# "on" â€“ and thus never turning the light off again).
