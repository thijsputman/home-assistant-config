# Heuristically track the Hue scene name based on the group's (i.e. room/zone)
# brightness, color_temp and/or xy_color (depending on what is available).
#
# Note that when a *zone* scene changes, the *room(s)* it belongs to keep
# reporting their previous scene as the active scene (i.e. some of their lights
# changed, but the Hue API doesn't report this change).
# I'm relying on this behaviour in some other (room/scene-related) automations.
# For the below it's relevant for our tracking of the previously active scene
# (which we want to be *different* from the current active scene, as otherwise
# tracking it serves little purpose...).
# The inverse behaviour does not apply to zones: Changing their containing
# room(s) does appear to change the active scene for the zone...
