              This is only works because there's two occupants with a single
              phone each, so the "not_home" phone always belongs to the person
              who's away...
              The reason the "source"-device from the above person's can't be
              used is the fact that each person has two devices: One (GPS-
              tracked) phone and one device who's MAC address is tracked on the
              network. The latter is often faster to respond, but of course
              doesn't provide an actual GPS location.
