# "TTS attention"-automations trigger important, but non-urgent/time-sensitive,
# notifications to be announced throughout the house.
#
# The announcements are queued up as they occur using "script.tts_queue". When
# any of the below automations trigger, they raise a "tss_attention" event with
# the relevant speaker (i.e., where to announce) in the event-data. This results
# in "script.tts_queue" releasing its queue into "script.tts_announce" which
# subsequently reads out all announcements.
#
# The goal is to define triggers that indicate immediate and purposeful human
# action (as opposed to most other automations which try to abstract away from
# explicit human actions). The thinking being that the best moment to send out
# (a blast of) TTS notification(s) is when someone is actively "interacting"
# with a room (e.g., switching on the lights; opening a window).
