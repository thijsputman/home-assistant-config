# The Blitzwolf BW-SHP13 is the only affordable 16A ZigBee smart-plug on the
# market that also supports metering â€“ with one major caveat: Its measurements
# are quite a bit off...
#
# Haven't bothered using a multi-meter, but comparing what is reported by the
# Blitzwolf versus DSMR, the factor of 0.88 mentioned in the below GitHub-issue
# appears quite accurate. Should be applied to both the power/current and the
# consumption (i.e. cumulative) measurements.
# N.B. Factor might be different from plug to plug, so revalidate whenever a
# new plug is added!
