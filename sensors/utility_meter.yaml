# Indicative measurements of flow-rates â€“ the derivative-platform doesn't work
# well here as these sensors update intermittently. That problem can be worked
# around, but I feel the below approach is actually nicer... For more details
# follow the thread here:

# The change-rate approximates the true derivative quite well; slightly under-
# estimates , but more "responsive" to changes in the flow-rate. The below is
# used for dashboarding and automations only, actual (long-term) consumption
# should always be gauged via the source (cumulative) sensors.
# There's a matching set of sensors in ðŸ“„ ./templates/utility_meter.yaml to
# account for the fact statistics goes to "unknown" when there's no change (and
# to allow for a proper "state_class" to be defined). The below are excluded
# from the recorder â€“ the template sensors should be used instead.
