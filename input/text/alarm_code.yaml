# Alarm code for Aarlo's alarm control panel
# Sadly, Aarlo doesn't support the "code_template" property (yet), so changing
# this value in the front-end UI will break several automations that depend on
# it...
# The current approach/workaround is thus purely to prevent the front-end from
# resolving the alarm code "!secret" when editting automations in the UI.
alarm_code:
  name: Alarm code
  icon: mdi:form-textbox-password
  mode: password
  min: 4
  max: 8
  pattern: '[0-9]*'
  initial: !secret alarm_code
