## Gammu (Vodafone NL prepaid top-up)

Several automations and a single template sensor useful in handling prepaid
SIM-card credit top-ups (written for Vodafone NL, but should be relatively
universal).

Works well, but the cost of prepaid SMS (â‚¬ 0.20 at Vodafone NL; â‚¬ 0.10 at the
cheapest provider) and the number of messages (especially when conversing with
the system) required is such that it quickly became more economical to get an
unlimited SMS subscription (â‚¬ 6 / month at Simyo).
