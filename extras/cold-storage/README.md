## Gammu (Vodafone NL prepaid top-up)

Several automations and a single template sensor useful in handling prepaid
SIM-card credit top-ups (written for Vodafone NL, but should be relatively
universal).

Works well, but the cost of prepaid SMS (â‚¬ 0.20 at Vodafone NL; â‚¬ 0.10 at the
cheapest provider) and the number of messages (especially when conversing with
the system) required is such that it quickly became more economical to get an
unlimited SMS subscription (â‚¬ 6 / month at Simyo).

Note that should this ever be reimplemented, the `sms_notification` script's
`phoneNumber`-parameter needs to be updated to allow sending messages to
Vodafone's top-up service number (`4000`). Also, the
`Gammu received (message count)`-sensor should be updated to ignore messages
from `<Vodafone>` to prevent overflowing the message counters with (irrelevant)
service messages.

## Synology

An automation, a dashboard card, and a template sensor used to provide an
overview of (and some reporting on) the state of my Synology DiskStation.

Given the (insanely) increased electricity prices and the fact that the Synology
was mainly still running for sentimental reasons, I've switched it off...
