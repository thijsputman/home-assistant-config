# Ping to MQTT (for DD-WRT)

Simple (POSIX-compliant) shell-script that pings a host-name once every minute
and publishes the average roundtrip time (by default based on four pings) to
MQTT.

Used on my DD-WRT router and access-points to monitor network/Internet
performance. There's a ping sensor running in Home Assistant too, but its
roundtrip times appear to vary greatly based on the load on the underlying RPi4
device. As such they are a less useful indication of overall network
performance...

## Installation

Requires JFFS (or some other form of persistent storage) and Entware installed
on the DD-WRT unit.

```shell
opkg install mosquitto-client-nossl
```

Copy the provided folder structure onto `üìÅ /jffs` and update
`üìÑ /jffs/etc/config/ping2mqtt.wanup` with your MQTT hostname and the MQTT topic
to publish to (and optionally change the number of pings and the ping target).

Note that `.wanup` entails the script is run (i.e. pinging starts) whenever the
WAN connection goes up. In case of an access-point, using `.startup` might be
more appropriate (i.e. WAN up might never occur on those devices). See
<https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Script_Execution> for more details.

## Usage

```shell
./ping2mqtt.sh mqtt-host mqtt-topic [ping-host] [count]
```

By default the `ping-host` is `8.8.8.8` (Google Public DNS) and `count` is `4`.

The script will run indefinitely; pinging and publishing to MQTT (approximately)
once per minute.

The script uses a (naive) locking approach to prevent spawning multiple
instances (as WAN up can occur an infinite number of times on a running DD-WRT
unit). A lock-file is written to `/tmp` (non-persistent storage; cleared at
reboot) and upon start the script will abort if the lock-file is present.

When receiving `INT`, `HUP`, `TERM` or `EXIT` the script will attempt to remove
the lock-file. This covers the most common termination scenarios and thus
entails the lock-file should be removed in those cases. The `EXIT` trap
specifically should ensure the script cleans up after itself in case one of the
commands it attempts to execute fails.
