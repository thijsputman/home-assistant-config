// The below is using one hour aggregate-window mean as poor man's way of

// "yesterday" are offset by either one (CET) or two (CEST) hours with regards
// to UTC. Although the data is correctly aggregated, I haven't yet managed to
// get the dynamic "today()/yesterday" time windows to work (hard-coding
// timestamps works fine).
