## Changes / Notes

- **14-4-2021 @ 11:15 CET** â€“ replaced `power_dishwasher_actual` with
  `power_88_actual` (as the former sensor got deleted). The measurements
  communicated should remain (broadly) unchanged (i.e. comparable)
- **27-4-2021 @ 06:00 CET** â€“ measurements for `sensor.power_88_actual` and
  `sensor.power_86_actual` are missing due to
  [an odd issue with the Zigbee-network](../../docs/deCONZ.md#ikea-tradfri-repeater)
  (resolved on 1-5-2021 @ 19:30 CET)
- **4-5-2021 @ 17:30 CET** â€“ the value for `sensor.power_lights_all` now also
  includes the stand-by consumption of all Zigbee bulbs
- **14-7-2021 @ 16:00 CET** â€“ added `sensor.gas_consumption` which should be
  preferred over the (still present) `sensor.hourly_gas_consumption` sensor.
  Home Assistant 2021.7
  [removed the hourly gas consumption reading from the DSMR integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/52147);
  it was reintroduced using the Derivative integration. Until 19-7-2021 @ 16:00
  CET the values were computed differently (higher derivative over a shorter
  timespan) compared to the values as previously computed by the DSMR
  integration.
- **18-7-2021 @ 15:00 CET** â€“ No data for `sensor.weewx_wind_speed` recorded due
  to a climbing plant getting in the way (resolved on 21-7-2021 @ 18:00 CET)
- **3-12-2021 @ 12:00 CET** - Renamed `sensor.ups_power` to
  `sensor.ups_power_usage`; renamed `sensor.power_lights_all` to
  `sensor.power_all_lights`
- **12-12-2021 @ 16:30 CET** â€“ `sensor.power_sonair_combined` now also includes
  power consumption for the (exhaust) fan in the Attic
- **23-1-2022 @ 03:20 CET** â€“ NVMe drive hosting the Home Assistant database
  detached/crashed; it appears all data came through regardless (recovered
  23-1-2022 @ 12:00 CET)
- **15-2-2022 @ 19:00 CET** â€“ Reduced precision from `ns` to `s`; sub-second
  precision seems a bit overkill for what I have in mind (the most frequently
  updating sensors do so every 30 seconds)
- **5-5-2022 @ 03:00 CET** â€“ Multi-sensor Attic (`sensor.temperature_3`) started
  intermittently reporting errant temperature values (-100 ÂºC). This coincided
  with an upgrade of deCONZ (which apparently suffered from a bug specifically
  effecting these multi-sensors). Nonetheless, after replacing the sensor's
  battery (around 11:00 CET that same day) the issue disappeared.
- **13-5-2022 @ 00:00 CET** â€“ `sensor.dd_wrt_1_wan_in_mbps` and
  `sensor.dd_wrt_1_wan_out_mbps` became unavailable due to an issue with the
  SNMP integration. The underlying issue was fixed by upgrading Home Assistant
  to version 2022.5.5 on 20-5-2022 @ 06:00.
- **8-6-2022 @ 12:30 CET** â€“ Internet connectivity was down until around 15:30
  CET; no data came through to Influx Cloud during that period.
- **8-6-2022 @ 21:00 CET** â€“ Ping sensor on DD-WRT-1
  (`sensor.dd_wrt_1_google_dns_roundtrip_time`) was down until around 23:00 CET.
- **26-7-2022 @ 10:40 CET** â€“ No data for `sensor.weewx_wind_speed` recorded due
  to the Wisteria getting in the way, again ðŸ˜‡ (resolved on 26-7-2022 @ 21:00
  CET)
- **1-9-2022** to **12-9-2022** â€” No data reported by `sensor.temperature_27`
  due to an empty battery while on Holiday...
- **15-9-2022 @ 00:00 CET** until **02:00 CET** â€” No data reported due to a DNS
  issue
- **26-9-2022** to **22-10-2022** â€” Odd data (bi-hourly spikes to an incorrect
  value) reported by both `sensor.aarlo_battery_level_front` and
  `sensor.aarlo_battery_level_back`
- **29-10-2022** to **3-11-2022** â€” No data reported for
  `sensor.tado_smart_radiator_attic_setpoint` (for unknown reason)
- **4-** & **5-11-2022 @ 04:30 CET** until **09:30 CET** â€” No data reported due
  to a Home Assistant crash (SSD disconnected during backup due to a hardware
  conflict on the USB bus)
- **8-11-2022 @ 00:00 CET** renamed `binary_sensor.vacation_mode` into
  `input_boolean.alarm_vacation_mode`
- **9-11-2022 @ 02:00 CET** until **09:00 CET** â€” No data reported due to
  continuing SSD issues; additional hickups win the evening while
  troubleshooting...
- **14-11-2022 @ 15:30 CET** â€” Physically swapped (and renamed) the `Front` and
  `Balcony` Arlo cameras. Motion detection on the (old) `Front` Arlo Pro 2 unit
  appears irreparably broken. To prevent unnecessary fidgeting for now, swapped
  it with the (much more recent) Balcony camera
- **16-11-2022 @ 02:30 CET** until **11:00 CET** â€” Vacation-mode got erroneously
  activated
- **29-12-2022** to **16-1-2023** â€” No data for
  `sensor.pi_hole_dns_unique_clients` as a result of a Pi-hole update that broke
  the Home Assistant integration
- **30-6-2023** â€” For most of June 2023, `sensor.weewx_wind_speed` reported
  no/incorrect data due to plants getting in the way of the sensor
- **19-7-2023** â€” Removed `sensor.hourly_gas_consumption`; a new approach to the
  derivate is used on the Home Assistant dashboards, in Influx
  `sensor.gas_consumption` should've already been used in instead...
- **19-8-2023** â€” Renamed `light.smart_relay_1` into `fan.bathroom`
- **19-9-2023** â€” Bought a new washing machine; use this date (with a couple
  days of margin) as the cut-off for power consumption (ie, "energy savings")
  analysis in the future...
- **30-12-2023 @ 15:00 CET** util **00:00 CET** â€” Na data for
  `sensor.dd_wrt_1_google_dns_roundtrip_time` due to the ping-script not
  properly starting after a reboot of DD-WRT-1
- **13-3-2024** â€“ Replaced `input_boolean.alarm_vacation_mode` with
  `alarm_control_panel.home_alarm`'s `armed_vacation`-state
