## REST-command scratch-pad

Using the wonderful
[`vscode-restclient`](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) VS Code
extension.

For the scratch-pad to work, `DECONZ_BASEURL` and `DECONZ_KEY` should be defined
a `üìÑ .env` file in the same folder.

## Custom Device Description Files (DDF)

Custom DDFs in [`üìÇ devices`](./devices/):

- [`üìÑ _TZ3000_r6buo8ba.json`](./devices/_TZ3000_r6buo8ba.json) ‚Äî Tuya ZigBee
  Smart Power Plug 16A (`TS011F` / `_TZ3000_r6buo8ba`). Taken from
  [deconz-rest-plugin#5633](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/5633#issuecomment-1152560580)
  (originally a different manufacturer, but works fine with this one too)
- [`üìÑ _TZE200_a7sghmms.json`](./devices/_TZE200_a7sghmms.json) ‚Äì see
  [Tuya Smart Watering Timer](#tuya-smart-watering-timer-_tze200_a7sghmms)

Copy these into the `devices`-folder of the deCONZ instance
(`/opt/deCONZ/devices` for the Docker-container). They're picked up
automatically after a deCONZ restart (or directly when manually loading them in
the DDF editor).

### Tuya Smart Watering Timer (`_TZE200_a7sghmms`)

Multiple variants of the device appear to be available (names; vendors ‚Äì always
the same physical appearance and "manufacturer" string though). I have
[this version from AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005196816776.html).

The DDF is based on
[deconz-rest-plugin#6143](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/6143);
using the below `INFO_L2`-output. It's identical to
[deconz-rest-plugin#6944](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/6944)
(which I only came across later ü§ê). Once
[deconz-rest-plugin#6947](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/pull/6947)
(the PR for **#6944**) gets merged, my custom DDF is ‚Äì in principle ‚Äì not needed
anymore.

Note that I've omitted the "advanced" features (e.g. irrigation cycle and device
mode) from the DDF as ‚Äì apart from exposing their values in the REST API ‚Äì they
don't appear have much use/benefit. Proper support for these features in the
deCONZ API (and Home Assistant for that matter) appears to be quite some way
off...

#### `INFO_L2`

```conf
# Open/close the valve

TY_DATA_REPORT: seq ..., dpid: 0x02, type: 0x01, length: 1, val: 0

# The volume (L) of water fed through the valve; resets to zero when opened.
# I've compared the consumption measurement with my home water meter's reading
# and it appears it accurately reports the volume dispensed in litres.
TY_DATA_REPORT: seq ..., dpid: 0x6F, type: 0x02, length: 4, val: 0

# Battery level
TY_DATA_REPORT: seq ..., dpid: 0x6C, type: 0x02, length: 4, val: 100

# Unknown; both appear always be zero zero
TY_DATA_REPORT: seq ..., dpid: 0x6A, type: 0x02, length: 4, val: 0
TY_DATA_REPORT: seq ..., dpid: 0x67, type: 0x02, length: 4, val: 0
```

#### Further Details

Water consumption is using `ZHAConsumption` with its value multiplied by `1,000`
and the `device_class` forced to `water` in Home Assistant to get a proper
representation of the volume (in litres) fed through the system. See
[homebridge-deconz#138](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-deconz/issues/138#issuecomment-1535456569)
for a related discussion as to why this is necessary.

For `swversion` to be properly reported,
[`üìÑ tuya_swversion.js`](./devices/tuya_swversion.js) should also be placed in
the `devices`-folder. This file is taken from
[`üìÇ deconz-rest-plugin/tree/master/devices/tuya`](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/tree/master/devices/tuya).
