## REST-command scratch-pad

Using the wonderful
[`vscode-restclient`](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) VS Code
extension.

For the scratch-pad to work, `DECONZ_BASEURL` and `DECONZ_KEY` should be defined
a `ðŸ“„ .env` file in the same folder.

## Custom Device Description Files (DDF)

Custom DDFs in [`ðŸ“‚ devices`](./devices/) â€” move into the `devices` folder of
the running deCONZ instance (and then be picked up automatically based on their
filenames):

- [`ðŸ“„ _TZ3000_r6buo8ba.json`](./devices/_TZ3000_r6buo8ba.json) â€” Tuya ZigBee
  Smart Power Plug 16A (`TS011F` / `_TZ3000_r6buo8ba`). Taken from
  [deconz-rest-plugin#5633](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/5633#issuecomment-1152560580)
  (originally a different manufacturer, but works fine with this one too)
