# Link Attic Philips Hue dimmer-switch with Aqara relay (lumi.relay.c2acn01)
#
# Does not appear to work as intended: The below commands establish group
# membership for the relay, but don't "stick". Once linked, the state of the
# relays and the switch/group is properly tracked by deCONZ, but that doesn't
# reflect their "physical" state. Only relay with ID 16 switches on (and it
# stays on regardless of what state deCONZ is in).
# The Aqara relay is at the latest firmware revision (checked via an Aqara M1S
# Hub). Probably an issue with / bug in deCONZ? Parked for now...
