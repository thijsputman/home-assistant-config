- [Alarm](#alarm)

## General

- [ ] Move all icon customisations for sensors defined in YAML from
      `ðŸ“„ customize.yaml` to their respective YAML files
- [ ] Clean-up the grossly inconsistent Zigbee entity-naming (half of them are
      `light_x`, `openclose_y`, the other half already have sensible names)
- [ ] Nintendo Switch on/off detection: This Switch comes online regularly for a
      minute or so, which makes the current approach for controlling the Living
      Room lights unusable. See if there's a(nother) way of handling this â€“ for
      now the automations are included, but disabled in the UI
- [ ] State attributes store history too, so there's no need to create template
      sensors if they're purely used for graphing in dashboards
      (`mini-graph-card` can graph attributes) or in other automations (use a
      template to retrieve the attribute's value)
  - Main value of template sensors is to easily retrieve an attribute's history
    without having it structural on a dashboard (i.e. incidental usage)
  - See which of the current template sensors (mainly tadoÂ° related) are
    actually useful given the above considerations; remove the ones that are
    not...
- [ ] Some of the automation/helper-combinations can be replaced with template
      sensors â€“ mainly those that effectively are nothing more than a set of
      operations on the state of one or more existing sensors:
  - âœ” Time of Day / Nighttime
  - The Hue scene heuristics â€“ might be more trouble than it's worth (unless
    this somehow enables the inputs for the heuristic to be stored outside of
    the template sensor)

## Lovelace

## tadoÂ°

- [ ] The "Off" state/`hvac_action` clears the setpoint temperature. Check if
      the Attic thermostat automations properly cope with that. Also, make the
      Attic thermostat follow the on/off state of the main thermostat
      (functionally not needed, mainly for consistency)
- [x] ~~Create several "backstops" (controlled via HomeKit) to ensure heating is
      properly controlled when there is no access to the online Tado service~~
  - On hold till the first time this actually turns out to be an issue. As of
    yet, the Tado online service has been rock-solid...

## Lights

- [ ] For Summer: Garden light automatic off at 22:30 should only happen if
      light state has not been modified manually (i.e. we're sitting outside)
- [ ] For Summer: Switch outside lights on earlier and switch them off later
- [ ] The transition from "lights off at dawn" to "daytime lights on when its
      dark during the day" is not optimal yet. At the moment I'm delaying the
      latter by 10 seconds to prevent it from interfering with the former, there
      should be a nicer way to handle that...
- [ ] Failure mode for Kitchen-counter motion lights: Switch Kitchen to
      "Ambiance", trigger counter motion sensor, switch Kitchen to "Bright
      (Custom)" (while motion sensor is still active). After motion clears,
      Kitchen switches back to "Ambiance" instead of to "Bright (Custom")
- [ ] Let the occupancy simulation toggle `input_boolean.everyone_asleep` when
      it switches off all lights (easiest way to keep consistent behaviour). Do
      ensure this doesn't conflict with the alarm settings

## Alarm

- [ ] ~~Flash the colour lamps/lights bulbs in the Living Room red while the
      alarm is activated;~~ also, check if the siren's light actually flashes
      when the alarm is sounding
  - Flashing the lights serves little purpose â€“ better idea: Get a second Zigbee
    siren (reduces the likelihood of them getting disabled in event of an
    emergency) and have a look at
    [dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin#3232](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/3232#issuecomment-688145449)
    on how to properly control them through deCONZ
- [ ] Currently Arlo's cameras are automatically armed daily at 22:30. Make this
      contingent on the state of the lights in the back garden (and/or the
      Kitchen door). When we're sitting outside late in Summer, don't arm Arlo
      (or at least not until the garden lights go off / Kitchen door remains
      closed for a while)
- [ ] Perhaps use the "Template Alarm Control Panel" instead of the current
      setup with a set of automations? Unsure whether that would really make
      thing easier to understand though...
- [ ] Set a basic Arlo schedule in the Arlo app (on every night, off in the
      morning) so it doesn't fully depend on Home Assistant; ensure the
      automations cope with the Arlo changing states outside of their control
- [ ] Implement the new "Saving Media"-functionality from version `0.7.1` of
      `hass-aarlo`
