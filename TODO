- [General](#general)
- [tadoÂ°](#tado)
- [Lights](#lights)
- [Alarm](#alarm)

## General

- Move all `input_*` definitions relevant to automations into separate YAML
  files (instead of defining them in the Lovelace UI; this makes the automations
  portable)
- When Home Assistant restarts, or the automations are reloaded, all timer
  states are lost. Might want to put some failsafes in place to deal with this
  better. For example the electric heater in the shed might inadvertently get
  stuck in the "on" state due to this...
- Further implement the doorbell sensor and the "washing machine done"-sensor
  (both based on creative usage of vibration sensors)
- Use the lux sensors in various rooms to replace the global solar irradiance
  measurement
- Replace use of `nighttime` helper with new `time_of_day` helper. See if it's
  possible to use it in the graphs too; then the `input_boolean.nighttime` can
  be deleted altogether
- Move all icon customisations for sensors defined in YAML from
  `ðŸ“„ customize.yaml` to their respective YAML files
- Nintendo Switch on/off detection: This Switch comes online regularly for a
  minute or so, which makes the current approach for controlling the Living Room
  lights unusable. See if there's a(nother) way of handling this â€“ for now the
  automations are included, but disabled in the UI

## tadoÂ°

- Test how the "Away" mode actually works. Does it switch the thermostat mode to
  "off", or does the mode not change (I expect the latter &ndash; in case of the
  former, some additional logic is required for the home/away automations)?
  - It appears the mode does not change (remains `heat`) â€“ it changes the
    temperature and sets the "online mode" to `away`
- Create several "backstops" (controlled via HomeKit) to ensure heating is
  properly controlled when there is no access to the Tado service (i.e. no
  Internet connection)

## Lights

- Daytime lights should respect wakeup time (similar to "Inside lights on (when
  dark at Â«wakeupÂ» time)")
- For Summer: Garden light automatic off at 22:30 should only happen if light
  state has not been modified manually (i.e. we're sitting outside)
- The transition from "lights off at dawn" to "daytime lights on when its dark
  during the day" is not optimal yet. At the moment I'm delaying the latter by
  10 seconds to prevent it from interfering with the former, there should be a
  nicer way to handle that...
- Failure mode for Kitchen-counter motion lights: Switch Kitchen to "Ambiance",
  trigger counter motion sensor, switch Kitchen to "Bright (Custom)" (while
  motion sensor is still active). After motion clears, Kitchen switches back to
  "Ambiance" instead of to "Bright (Custom")

## Alarm

- Flash the colour lamps/lights bulbs in the Living Room red while the alarm is
  activated; also, check if the siren's light actually flashes when the alarm is
  sounding
- Use the buttons in the bedroom to disable the siren (only when the alarm is
  sounding) â€“ pressing the button again should re-enable the sound
- Currently Arlo's cameras are automatically armed daily at 22:30. Make this
  contingent on the state of the lights in the back garden. When we're sitting
  outside late in Summer, don't arm Arlo (or at least not until the garden
  lights go off)
- Perhaps use the "Template Alarm Control Panel" instead of the current setup
  with a set of automations? Unsure whether that would really make thing easier
  to understand though...
