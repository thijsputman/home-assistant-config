## General

### Bugs

- [ ] The `sensor.consumption_ups` (Riemann sum integral) deviates a lot from
      its expected daily total (sometimes reporting less than 30% of what it
      should be) every couple of days
  - Appears to be the result of the UPS power consumption not fluctuating
    enough. It stays at the same level for long periods; if that happens at the
    end of the day, the final hours of the day aren't counted...
- [ ] Why does `device_attr(device_id(...), 'name')` keep referring to
      `Close-in boiler (Kitchen)` as `Power 151`? The device name is correctly
      set in Home Assistant — perhaps reset the device's name in deCONZ to see
      if the resolves the issue?

### Home Assistant Updates

Changes to Home Assistant; to be further explored/implemented (or just for
future reference).

- [ ] [2023.2: Grouping sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/02/01/release-20232/#grouping-sensors)
      — and related helper changes (could replace some of the older "arithmetic"
      templates)

### Features

- [ ] ~~Use generic names for the mobile devices registered through the "Mobile
      App" integration~~ (`pixel_6_pro`, `sm_g990b2` and `p20hd_eea`) — seeing
      as how these devices are only referenced in a few places, easier to
      reference them from `secrets.yaml`
  - Knowing the model numbers of these devices allows one to deduce the vendor
    prefixes of their WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, which in turn _could_ be
    used to pinpoint the exact location of the house (if the combination of the
    three device types is unique enough – which it might).
- [ ] Use the power consumption sensor for the "multimedia hub" in the Living
      room to detect if the projector is on (in which case certain lighting
      automation should be disabled) – as an addition to the Android TV based
      automations (which work well, but only when the Android TV is active and
      not, for example, when the Nintendo Switch is used)
- [ ] Enable the `retain`-attribute for all MQTT-topics (either by updating the
      publishing logic, or by manually toggling the attribute on the MQTT server
      itself?)
- [ ] Add tilt sensors to all "tilting" windows; only works for vertically
      tilting windows ("kiepraam") though
  - Use these (in addition to the `openclose` sensors) to detect a potential
    break-in (i.e. windows can be left ajar and still trigger the alarm)
  - Perhaps provide a warning when the Attic window is fully closed (in
    principle it's ventilation hatch should always be open) – same for the
    Bedroom, when we go to bed at least one of the windows should be ajar...
    This could be via TTS when all lights are switched off before going to bed
- [ ] Explicitly check the (most relevant) arguments for (important) scripts and
      if they're invalid, write an error to the log to aid in debugging?

### Development Environment

- [ ] Validate all Home Assistant YAML-files against their (JSON) schemas prior
      to committing (and as part of the linter GitHub Action)

## Dashboards

### Bugs

- [ ] Using the `direct-stream` option in the `image-view`-list of
      `lovelace-hass-aarlo` causes some funky behaviour: It streams the video
      (as intended), but also starts streaming _all_ other camera's visible on
      the dashboard. Leaving it on `direct` mitigates the issue for now...
  - Appears to keep going after closing the dashboard; the error-log fills up
    with
    `Error opening stream (INVALIDDATA, Invalid data found when processing input)`

### General

- [ ] Add an overview of motion/vibration sensors
  - Perhaps create separate Security-dashboard?
- [ ] Add buttons to toggle the entire house to a specific Hue scene ("Alarm",
      "Active" and "Ambiance")

## Notifications

### Bugs

- [ ] `script.persistent_notification`'s "home"-state should ideally be based on
      the person's `person`-entity state, not on their mobile phone's state
      (this uses GPS and is less reactive than the overall `person`-state)

### Mobile

- [ ] Change click-action based on notification context
- [ ] Allow notifications to be dismissed even if `lovelaceDismiss` is _not_
      enabled; this is currently impossible. See
      `📄 automations/alarm/away.yaml` for an example where this causes a
      (highly theoretical 😉) vulnerability
- [ ] It appears that dismissing (i.e. "swiping away") notifications on Android
      raises an event on the Home Assistant side – useful to act on this?
- [ ] Change
      [the status bar icon](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic/#notification-status-bar-icon)
      for certain notifications
- [ ] Implement
      "[alert once](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic/#alert-once)"
      for certain notifications?
- [ ] The maximum length of the notification message shown is platform (and
      device?) dependent. On my current (Android 13) device, it appears limited
      to 10 lines (based on the actual number of lines, _not_ the amount of
      characters). Messages are truncated _without_ a clear indication; this can
      lead to confusion. It might thus be better to put a (conservative) limit
      on the length of the message and provide a clear indication the message
      got truncated...

### Voice / TTS

🎉

### SMS

- [ ] Control lighting (status; switch rooms on and off)
- [ ] Control heating/airco (status; switch heating/airco on and off)

## Climate & Air-quality

### Bugs

- [ ] Living room Sonair template fan speed sensor incorrectly jumps between 40%
      and 60% at night (while it should be stable at 60%); the Wardrobe Sonair
      template fan speed sensor incorrectly jumps between 20% and 40% when it
      should be stable at 40%...
- [ ] ❗ The "auto"-mode for the tado° Attic heating appears to not be restored
      at the end of the day; this results in the schedule not getting applied
      the following day (and the heating only turning on when occupancy is
      detected in the Attic)

### Features

- [ ] Create several "backstops" (controlled via HomeKit) to ensure heating is
      properly controlled when there is no access to the online Tado service
  - It appears Tado's schedule is enforced _remotely_ (i.e. if there's no active
    Internet connection, the scheduled settings are _not_ applied). Thus, sadly,
    the schedule should be enforced/backstopped locally via HomeKit...
- [ ] See if it's possible to better combine Attic thermostat/heating and airco
      automations – there's currently a lot of (semi-)identical stuff there (and
      some slightly different approaches aiming to achieve the same thing)...
- [ ] Reset the Attic radiator back to "scheduled mode" every night (similar to
      what happens with the Airco) to ensure it keeps following the schedule
      regardless of what happened the day before
- [ ] Just like the heating in the Attic, the airco unit most likely also needs
      to be switched off manually when Tado transitions from Away- to Home-mode
      (otherwise it reverts back to its schedule and switches on even though
      no-one is present in the Attic)
- [ ] Implement proper controls for the Airco in the Bedroom (most probably
      delayed till next Summer, there wasn't any need for it this year 🌦️😢)
  - Use Broadlink IR-blaster to control fan direction and some other advanced
    options not available in tado° (in response to tado° actions)
- [ ] Switch on the Attic (exhaust) ventilator when the CO₂ gets above 1,000 PPM
      in the Attic (and the Attic is occupied). Probably good to also switch it
      on during the night regardless...
- [ ] Define template binary sensors for "Living room thermostat on" and "Attic
      radiator on". This is currently hard-coded in multiple automations based
      on temperature setpoints (> 16ºC and 18ºC respectively). Better to
      abstract this away.
- [ ] Rename `sensor.xiaomi_miot_environment_co2_density` to match with the
      other Qingping senors
- [ ] ~~A sudden substantial increase in PM indicates a fire (or some kind of
      calamity); experiment with using this to trigger the alarm~~
  - Additionally, increases in CO₂ levels when no-one is home (i.e. Home Alarm
    is "Armed away") might indicate some-one is in the house...

## Lights

### Bugs

🎉

### Features

- [ ] Have Attic lights automatically change light temperature in the evening...
- [ ] Daytime lights in the downstairs Hallway are switched on a bit too much...
- [ ] Have the buttons next to the bed cycle through various light modes (with
      long press)
- [ ] Containerize the Fireplace Node.js code; create some helpers scripts in
      Home Assistant to facilitate the switching on/off (mainly so that their
      previous state gets automatically restored)
- [ ] Create a toggle in Lovelace stop the television from overriding the
      lighting settings (for when not everyone is watching television) – there's
      a lot of "magic" automation potential here, but the best solution is most
      likely to manual turn off the behaviour when it's unwanted... 😇

## Alarm

### Bugs

🎉

### Features

- [ ] Occupancy simulation: Randomly trigger the "Active" scenes in the Kitchen
      and Living room around dinner time; randomly trigger "Movie" scenes later
      in the evening
- [ ] Occupancy simulation: Randomly switch on Bedroom lights around bedtime;
      switch them off around the time "Lights out" gets started

## Arlo

- [ ] Send notifications (with snapshot/thumbnail) if Arlo records something
      when "Armed away"
  - Replaces the "native" Arlo notifications
  - Experiment with including videos instead of still images
- [ ] Arlo snapshots used in notifications should be stored locally. The URL
      provided by Arlo always represents the _latest_ snapshot, not the specific
      snapshot at the point in time the URL was retrieved... This is problematic
      for notifications in Lovelace as they will (after a while) start showing
      the wrong image (i.e. the image is loaded when the notification is viewed,
      not – as on Android – when the notification is raised)
- [ ] Organise the Arlo captures in yearly folders
- [ ] 🚀 Way out there: Use a machine-learned model to classify the camera
      snapshots and act on them only if there's something out of the ordinary
      going on...

## Network

- [ ] Upgrade both DD-WRT units to the latest firmware version
- [ ] Setup a "devices" VLAN and a separate "devices" WiFi and setup switches
      and routing in such a way that only Home Assistant's Raspberry Pi can talk
      to both the _regular_ and the "devices" network
  - Move all untrusted/"IoT"-type devices to the "devices" network/WiFi
  - Limit/prevent Internet access for all Qingping and Broadlink devices. It
    should be easy to toggle this on and off on demand as occasionally Internet
    connectivity _is_ required to setup/configure these devices
- [ ] The SSH-key and OpenVPN-certificate used on my phone have the wrong Common
      Name (namely, that of one of my previous phones)
- [ ] Add OpenVPN usage counters (VPN in / VPN out; probably easiest via SNMP)

## Devices & Hardware

### General

- [ ] The Xiaomi two-gang Zigbee relay (`lumi.relay.c2acn01`) in the Attic
      hallway sometimes refuses to switch off. The Zigbee network thinks the
      light(s) is/are off (they're actually still on); turning them off again
      properly turns off the light(s).
  - Bought some alternative relays to experiment with; might also consider
    checking (again) if the firmware is up-to-date (all of which requires the
    unit to be physically removed from its ceiling hideout 😒)
  - See [`📄 extras/scratch-pad.http`](extras/deconz/scratch-pad.http) for a
    (potentially) related issue in assigning this relay directly a switch
    (without needing a controller)
- [ ] Both the Qingping and Broadlink devices need Internet-connectivity to be
      set up. Once they're up and running they are managed fully locally – no
      need for Internet-connectivity. Block their MAC addresses in the router to
      prevent them from "phoning home" (actually, more to prevent people from
      "phoning in" through them).
  - Block their MAC addresses in DD-WRT
- [ ] Replace the ~~Living Room "copper lamp"~~, upstairs Hallway, and Guestroom
      bulbs with Hue filament bulbs (and remove the Zigbee-units from their
      cabling / power-sockets)
- [ ] The single Pi-hole instance is a **substantial** single point of failure
      in the network; consider running a backup Pi-hole on another machine
      (configs will need to be synced though)

### Bluetooth

- [ ] The M5Stack Atom Lite Bluetooth proxies appear to be working just fine
  - [ ] Consider moving the Air Monitor Lite-devices (Xiaomi Miot) over from
        WiFi to Bluetooth — only makes sense if it's possible to use them
        disconnected from the WiFi though (there are no problems with the Xiaomi
        Miot integration; just seems more sensible to run these devices over
        Bluetooth)
  - [ ] Conversely: See if it's possible to disable Bluetooth on the
        `Air Monitor Lite`-devices when used over WiFi — the unbound Bluetooth
        devices are effectively "leaking" occupancy information (ie. CO₂ levels)
        to the outside world...

### HA Yellow

- [ ] Switch Home Assistant container over to the HA Yellow device
