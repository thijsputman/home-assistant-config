# When database file becomes unavailable, Home Assistant quickly runs itself
# into the ground (OOM-killer gets involved ðŸ˜‰) reporting the below two errors
# over and over again â€” the hope is that by not logging these, Home Assistant
# will at least keep running (which is better than crashing, restarting and
# coming backup in safe mode without anything working).
# This might cause some more benign errors to be filtered out too, for now
# that's an acceptable trade off...
